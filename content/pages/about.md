# Hi, I'm Callum White

As a hardworking, mature, and driven individual with over 8 years of commercial experience in the software industry, I can offer the highest level of commitment and motivation to deliver a professional demeanour. 

During my career in development, I have successfully built .NET cloud base analytical and warehouse management systems, HR and Payroll, with multiple integration modules between both products. However, as an innovative individual, I strive to adapt and expand my skillset as technology advances and changes.

Currently a Data Engineer at MHR
